Hi, I'm Nick!

I'm a Senior Software Engineer. I've recently started a new passion project I'm calling âœ¨*Open Source Education*âœ¨ ( or OSE for short ðŸ˜Ž ), which lives [here](https://ose-dev.github.io/). 

My experience lies mainly in full stack web application development and backend microservices for big data usage, but for OSE I'm building the components to be largely
desktop/mobile app, so I am diving into .Net MAUI to support it. 

I've got a long ways to go, but I'm excited for the journey and hoping to connect with more developers, analysts, and content creators looking to enhance the 
availability of educational content!
